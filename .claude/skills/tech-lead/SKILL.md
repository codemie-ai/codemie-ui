# Tech Lead: Structured Implementation Guide

## Purpose

This skill acts as a technical lead to guide implementation of features and tasks with a structured approach. It bridges the gap between requirements and code by:
- Gathering requirements (from Jira tickets or user descriptions)
- Analyzing codebase and architectural patterns
- Assessing complexity and risks
- Creating feature branches
- Driving implementation with proper guidance

The skill ensures structured, informed development that follows project patterns and architectural guidelines.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Starting work on a Jira ticket (EPMCDME-XXXX)
- Implementing a new feature or task (with or without Jira ticket)
- Need to assess implementation complexity before coding
- Want guidance on where and how to implement changes
- Need to create a proper feature branch
- Transitioning from requirements to implementation

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirement Gathering

**Step 1: Determine Requirement Source**

Check if user provided:
- **Jira ticket ID** (EPMCDME-XXXXX format)
- **Task description** (user-provided text)

**Step 1a: If Jira Ticket Provided**

Use the brianna skill to fetch ONLY description and summary fields:

```
Use Skill tool with skill="brianna" and args containing:
- Action: get ticket details
- Ticket ID: [provided by user]
- Fields: description, summary ONLY
```

Do NOT request other fields like status, assignee, or custom fields unless explicitly needed for complexity assessment.

**Step 1b: If Task Description Provided**

If user provides a task description without a Jira ticket:

1. **Confirm understanding** of the requirements
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements are vague
3. **Document requirements** in a structured format for later reference

Example:
```markdown
## Task Requirements

**Goal**: [What needs to be implemented]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

**Context**: [Any additional context or constraints]
```

**Step 2: Branch Naming Decision**

Determine appropriate branch name:

**If Jira ticket exists:**
- Branch name: `EPMCDME-XXXXX` (exact ticket ID)

**If no Jira ticket:**
- Ask user for preferred branch name
- Suggest format: `feature/descriptive-name` or `task/descriptive-name`
- Example: `feature/add-user-logging`, `task/improve-error-handling`

### Phase 2: Technical Analysis

**Step 3: Explore Codebase and Guides**

After obtaining ticket details, perform targeted exploration:

1. **Check Relevant Guides First (MANDATORY)**
   - Identify task category from ticket (UI Components, Forms, Modals, State, API, Styling, etc.)
   - Use Read tool to load P0 guides from `.codemie/guides/`
   - Reference CLAUDE.md Task Classifier for guide mapping

2. **Search Codebase**
   - Use Grep to find related code patterns (glob `*.tsx`, `*.ts`)
   - Use Glob to locate relevant files
   - Identify existing implementations to follow

3. **Understand Architecture**
   - Determine affected layers (Component → Store → API)
   - Identify integration points
   - Check for similar existing features

**Exploration Guidelines:**
- Focus on code patterns mentioned in ticket
- Prioritize guides over blind codebase search
- Look for existing similar implementations
- Identify affected components and dependencies

**Step 4: Clarifying Questions (Selective)**

Ask clarifying questions ONLY when:
- Requirements are ambiguous or contradictory
- Multiple valid implementation approaches exist
- Architectural decisions need user input
- Ticket lacks critical technical details

**Do NOT ask about:**
- Information already present in code
- Generic questions ("Should I use async?")
- Standard patterns covered in guides
- Details that can be inferred from existing implementations

Use AskUserQuestion tool with focused, specific questions that unblock implementation decisions.

### Phase 3: Complexity Assessment

**Step 5: Analyze and Report Complexity**

Provide a structured complexity assessment in this format:

```markdown
## Implementation Analysis: [TICKET-ID]

### Complexity Rating: [Simple | Medium | Complex]

### Reasoning:
- **[Point 1]**: [Explanation of complexity factor]
- **[Point 2]**: [Explanation of complexity factor]
- **[Point 3]**: [Explanation of complexity factor]
- **[Point 4]**: [Explanation of complexity factor - optional]

### Clarity Assessment:
[Clear | Partially Clear | Unclear] - [Brief explanation]

### Affected Components:
- **[Component/Page/Store/Hook 1]**: [File path] - [Nature of change]
- **[Component/Page/Store/Hook 2]**: [File path] - [Nature of change]
- **[Component/Page/Store/Hook 3]**: [File path] - [Nature of change]
```

**Complexity Criteria:**

**Simple:**
- Single component affected
- Well-defined requirements
- Existing patterns to follow
- No architectural decisions needed
- Estimated 1-3 files to change

**Medium:**
- 2-3 UI areas affected (component + store, or page + form + store)
- Clear requirements with minor gaps
- May require some architectural decisions
- Estimated 4-8 files to change
- Requires coordination between layers

**Complex:**
- 4+ UI areas affected (multiple pages/stores/components)
- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Significant architectural decisions needed
- Estimated 9+ files to change
- Cross-cutting concerns (routing, global state, performance)
- New integrations, third-party libraries, or major refactoring

### Phase 4: Recommendation

**Step 6: Provide Implementation Recommendation**

Based on complexity assessment, provide one of these recommendations:

**For Simple/Medium Complexity:**
```markdown
### Recommendation

This feature is [Simple/Medium] complexity and can be implemented directly.

**Suggested Approach:**
1. Create feature branch: `[branch-name]`
2. [Step-by-step implementation guidance]
3. [Key patterns to follow]
4. [Testing approach]

Upon user confirmation, create the feature branch and begin implementation.
```

**For Complex Complexity:**
```markdown
### Recommendation

This feature is Complex and would benefit from architectural planning.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
1. Use solution-architect skill to create detailed specification
2. Address architectural decisions: [list key decisions]
3. Define interfaces and contracts
4. Create implementation plan with milestones

Alternatively, proceed with implementation if user accepts the complexity. Ask user to choose approach.
```

### Phase 5: Implementation Start

**Step 7: Branch Creation and Implementation**

If user agrees to proceed with implementation:

**CRITICAL: Always create feature branch before any code changes**

1. **Create Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   # Check current branch
   git branch --show-current

   # Create and switch to feature branch
   # For Jira tickets:
   git checkout -b EPMCDME-XXXXX

   # For non-Jira tasks (use determined branch name):
   git checkout -b feature/branch-name
   ```

2. **Verify Branch:**
   ```bash
   # Confirm on new branch
   git branch --show-current
   ```

3. **Begin Implementation:**
   - Follow patterns identified in analysis phase
   - Reference guides for standard approaches
   - Implement changes layer by layer (Store → Component → Page)
   - Apply accessibility and performance patterns

**Branch Naming:**

For Jira tickets:
- Format: `EPMCDME-XXXXX` (exactly as ticket ID)
- No prefixes like `feature/` or `fix/`
- Use ticket number as-is

For non-Jira tasks:
- Format: `feature/descriptive-name` or `task/descriptive-name`
- Use kebab-case for names
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Examples: `feature/add-logging`, `task/refactor-auth`

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Start with store (API calls, global state)
- Then component logic (hooks, forms)
- Then UI layer (JSX, styling with Tailwind)
- Test incrementally
- Follow project patterns in guides

## Key Principles

### Do's
✅ Always check guides before searching codebase
✅ Accept both Jira tickets and task descriptions
✅ Fetch only required Jira fields (description, summary) when applicable
✅ Provide evidence-based complexity assessment
✅ Create feature branch BEFORE any changes
✅ Follow established patterns from guides
✅ Ask specific, blocking questions only
✅ Provide clear, actionable recommendations
✅ Adapt branch naming to context (Jira vs non-Jira)

### Don'ts
❌ Don't skip guide consultation
❌ Don't ask generic clarifying questions
❌ Don't start coding without branch creation
❌ Don't make architectural decisions for complex features without user input
❌ Don't fetch unnecessary Jira fields (when using Jira)
❌ Don't guess at complexity—analyze systematically
❌ Don't assume every task has a Jira ticket

## Example Workflow

### Example 1: Simple Feature (Jira Ticket)

```
User: "Implement EPMCDME-10500"

Tech Lead:
1. Identifies Jira ticket format
2. Fetches ticket via brianna (description + summary)
3. Reads .codemie/guides/components/component-patterns.md
4. Searches for similar components with Grep (glob: *.tsx)
5. Assesses: Simple (1 component, standard UI pattern, existing pattern)
6. Recommends: Direct implementation
7. Creates branch: EPMCDME-10500
8. Implements following component patterns and Tailwind styling
```

### Example 1b: Simple Feature (No Jira Ticket)

```
User: "Add a loading state to the data table"

Tech Lead:
1. Identifies task description (no Jira ticket)
2. Documents requirements in structured format
3. Asks user for branch name preference
4. Reads .codemie/guides/components/reusable-components.md
5. Searches for existing loading/skeleton patterns with Grep
6. Assesses: Simple (1 file, standard pattern, clear requirements)
7. Recommends: Direct implementation
8. Creates branch: feature/add-table-loading
9. Implements following component patterns
```

### Example 2: Medium Feature (Jira Ticket)

```
User: "Start work on EPMCDME-10600"

Tech Lead:
1. Fetches ticket via brianna
2. Reads guides: patterns/state-management.md, development/api-integration.md
3. Searches codebase for similar store and component patterns
4. Asks: "Should data be paginated or loaded all at once?"
5. Assesses: Medium (new store + component + page, 5 files, clear patterns)
6. Recommends: Direct implementation with guidance
7. Creates branch: EPMCDME-10600
8. Implements store → component → page following Valtio patterns
```

### Example 3: Complex Feature

```
User: "Implement EPMCDME-10700"

Tech Lead:
1. Fetches ticket via brianna
2. Reads multiple guides (architecture, workflows, state-management)
3. Identifies: 12+ files affected, new workflow editor integration
4. Asks: "Should this reuse existing store or be isolated?" "What's the routing structure?"
5. Assesses: Complex (multi-layer, new patterns, performance concerns)
6. Recommends: Use solution-architect skill first
7. If user insists: Creates branch and starts with high-level plan
```
